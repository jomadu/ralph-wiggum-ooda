# Write Gap Report

Create a gap analysis report using the file writing tool.

Include:
- Summary of gaps found
- Spec-to-impl gaps (specified but not implemented)
- Impl-to-spec gaps (implemented but not specified)
- Impact assessment for each gap
- Recommended actions

After writing, validate your output:
- Is it minimal? (No unnecessary content)
- Is it complete? (All gaps documented)
- Is it accurate? (Gaps match analysis)

Only proceed to emit_success if validation passes.
