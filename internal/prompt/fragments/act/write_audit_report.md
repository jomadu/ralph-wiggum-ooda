# Write Audit Report

Create an audit report documenting findings using the file writing tool.

Include:
- Executive summary of findings
- Detailed list of issues with evidence
- Quality criteria results (PASS/FAIL)
- Prioritized recommendations
- Metrics and statistics

After writing, validate your output:
- Is it minimal? (No unnecessary content)
- Is it complete? (All required sections present)
- Is it accurate? (Findings match evidence)

Only proceed to emit_success if validation passes.
