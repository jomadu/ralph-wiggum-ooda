# Study Specifications

You must study specification files as defined in AGENTS.md. Use the file reading tool to access these files.

Read all files matching the specification definition patterns. For each spec, extract and understand:
- Job to be Done (JTBD) - the core problem being solved
- Acceptance criteria - measurable success conditions
- Examples - concrete usage scenarios
- Cross-references to other specs
- Current implementation status (if documented)

Remember this information for later analysis phases.
