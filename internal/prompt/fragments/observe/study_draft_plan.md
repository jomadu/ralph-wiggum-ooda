# Study Draft Plan

You must study the draft plan as defined in AGENTS.md. Use the appropriate tool to access the draft plan (file reading, API calls, command execution, etc.).

Analyze and extract:
- Planned tasks and their descriptions
- Task priorities and dependencies
- Implementation approach and strategy
- Acceptance criteria for each task
- Rationale for task breakdown and ordering

Understand the overall plan structure and intent. Remember this information for use in later phases.
