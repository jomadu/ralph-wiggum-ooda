# Study Implementation

You must study implementation files as defined in AGENTS.md. Use the file reading tool to access these files.

Read all files matching the implementation definition patterns. For each file, analyze and understand:
- Code structure and organization
- Key functions, classes, and entry points
- Dependencies and imports
- Design patterns and architectural decisions
- Current state and completeness

Remember this information for later analysis phases.
