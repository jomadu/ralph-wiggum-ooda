# Study Task Input

You must study the task description as defined in AGENTS.md. Use the appropriate tool to access the task input (file reading, API calls, command execution, etc.).

Analyze and extract:
- Task title and description
- Requirements and constraints
- Expected outcomes and success criteria
- Context and background information
- Scope boundaries (what's in/out of scope)

Understand the intent behind the task, not just the literal text. Remember this information for use in later phases.
