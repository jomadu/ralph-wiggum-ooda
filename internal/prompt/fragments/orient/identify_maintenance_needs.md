# Identify Maintenance Needs

Your task is to identify maintenance work needed in specifications or code within the scope defined in the maintenance request.

Find maintenance tasks in the target area.

Look for:
- Outdated dependencies
- Deprecated API usage
- TODO or FIXME comments
- Missing documentation
- Technical debt markers

Focus only on the scope identified in the maintenance request. Do not expand analysis beyond that boundary.
