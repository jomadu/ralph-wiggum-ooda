# Identify Complexity Issues

Your task is to identify overly complex code that should be simplified within the scope defined in the refactoring request.

Find overly complex code in the target area.

Look for:
- High cyclomatic complexity
- Deeply nested conditionals
- Complex boolean expressions
- Long parameter lists
- Difficult to understand logic

Focus only on the scope identified in the refactoring request. Do not expand analysis beyond that boundary.
