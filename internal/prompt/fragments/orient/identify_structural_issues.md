# Identify Structural Issues

Your task is to identify structural problems in specifications or code organization within the scope defined in the refactoring request.

Find organizational and structural problems in the target area.

Look for:
- Poor file organization
- Circular dependencies
- Inconsistent naming conventions
- Duplicated structure
- Missing abstractions

Focus only on the scope identified in the refactoring request. Do not expand analysis beyond that boundary.
