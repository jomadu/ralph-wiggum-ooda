# Identify Duplication

Your task is to identify duplicated content in specifications or code within the scope defined in the refactoring request.

Find duplicated content in the target area.

Look for:
- Repeated text or requirements
- Copy-pasted code blocks
- Redundant specifications
- Similar functions that could be unified
- Duplicated configuration

Focus only on the scope identified in the refactoring request. Do not expand analysis beyond that boundary.
