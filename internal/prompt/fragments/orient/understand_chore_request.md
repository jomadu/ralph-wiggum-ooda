# Understand Chore Request

Your task is to parse the task input (per AGENTS.md) and understand the specific maintenance work requested.

Extract from the task description:
- What maintenance tasks are needed
- Scope of the maintenance work
- Specific items to update or fix
- Dependencies or tools involved
- Areas explicitly out of scope

Focus only on what the task requests. Do not expand scope beyond the stated maintenance target.
