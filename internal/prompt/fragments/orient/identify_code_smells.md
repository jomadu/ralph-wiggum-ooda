# Identify Code Smells

Your task is to identify code quality issues and anti-patterns in the implementation within the scope defined in the refactoring request.

Find code quality issues and anti-patterns in the target area.

Look for:
- Long functions or methods
- Deep nesting
- Magic numbers or strings
- Tight coupling
- God objects or classes
- Inappropriate intimacy

Focus only on the scope identified in the refactoring request. Do not expand analysis beyond that boundary.
