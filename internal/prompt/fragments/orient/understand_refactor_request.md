# Understand Refactor Request

Your task is to parse the task input (per AGENTS.md) and understand the specific refactoring scope requested.

Extract from the task description:
- What code or specs need refactoring
- Boundaries of the refactoring scope
- Specific structural problems to address
- Constraints or requirements
- Areas explicitly out of scope

Focus only on what the task requests. Do not expand scope beyond the stated refactoring target.
