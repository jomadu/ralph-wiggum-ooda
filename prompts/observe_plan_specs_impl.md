# Observe: Plan, Specifications, and Implementation

Read AGENTS.md first to understand:
- What constitutes "specification" in this repository
- What constitutes "implementation" in this repository
- How to build and test

Then observe:
- PLAN.md (current state and next tasks)
- Specifications (per AGENTS.md definition)
- Implementation (per AGENTS.md definition)

Focus on gathering information needed to understand the current state and what work needs to be done.
