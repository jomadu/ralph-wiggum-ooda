# Act: Build

Execute your decision:

1. Implement the task
2. Run tests per AGENTS.md
3. Update PLAN.md (mark task complete or update status)
4. Update AGENTS.md if you learned something new
5. Commit if tests pass (after all file updates)

Do not commit if tests fail. Update PLAN.md with the failure and what needs to be fixed.
